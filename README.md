## (WIP)
A game master assistant for Monte Cook's tabletop RPG Cypher System.
Program created using the Cypher System Reference Document (CSRD) in compliance with the Cypher System Open License (CSOL).  

Currently I'm working on new player character generation. 
Cypher system is interesting because it uses a mad-libs style fill in the blank sentece to create new player charecters
